## What is a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file?

The Portable Executable (PE) format is a file format for executable files, object code, and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) on Windows operating systems. It is a complex format, but understanding its basic structure can be helpful for security professionals and developers alike.

A PE file is divided into several sections, each of which contains a different type of data. The header section contains information about the file's overall structure, such as its size, the number of sections, and the entry point. The sections section contains the actual code, data, and resources that make up the program.

The imports section lists the external functions that the program needs to call. The exports section lists the functions that the program exports to other modules. The resources section contains the program's resources, such as icons, images, and strings.

### PE File Structure Overview

A PE file, also known as a Portable Executable file, is a standard file format for executables, object code, and DLLs in Windows. PE files are structured in a specific way, which allows the Windows operating system to load and execute them.

The PE file format defines the structure used for executable files in Windows operating systems. A PE file consists of several parts:

* **DOS header**: This is a small header left over from older DOS executables. It contains things like the magic number "MZ" to identify it as a DOS header. This header is no longer used by Windows, but is kept for backwards compatibility.
* **PE header**: This contains key information about the PE file such as the machine type it is intended for, the number of sections in the file, the sizes of the optional header and file, and the file's entry point address. For example, a typical PE header would contain values like 0x014C for i386 architecture, 0x06 for the number of sections, etc.
* **Section headers**: These define the different sections in the PE file. For instance, there may be .text, .data, and .rsrc sections to contain the executable code, program data, and resources respectively. The section headers specify details like the section name, its starting address, its size in memory, etc.
* **Data directories**: These contain pointers to certain data in the file. For example, the import data directory contains RVA pointers to the file's import table which lists out the DLLs and functions used. The export directory contains information about functions exported by the file.
* **Sections**: These are the actual data contents of the file, which are divided into the different sections defined by the section headers. For example, the .text section would contain the executable code, the .data section would contain program variables, and the .rsrc section would contain the PE file's resources.

The PE file structure is a complex format, but it is essential for running programs on Windows. Here are some of the benefits of using PE files:

* **Portability**: PE files are portable, which means that they can be run on different versions of Windows. This is because the PE header contains information about the file's format, which allows the Windows operating system to load and execute the file even if it is from a different version of Windows.
* **Efficiency**: PE files are efficient, which means that they can be loaded and executed quickly by the Windows operating system. This is because the PE header contains information about the file's sections, which allows the Windows operating system to load only the sections that are needed by the program.
* **Security**: PE files are secure, which means that they can be protected from malware and other threats. This is because the PE header contains information about the file's digital signature, which allows the Windows operating system to verify that the file is from a trusted source.

Here are some of the top tools for analyzing the Portable Executable (PE) file format on Windows:

- [PE-Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear) - Multi-platform reversing tool for PE files, based on bearparser & capstone. Its objective is to deliver fast and flexible “first view” for malware analysts, stable and capable to handle malformed PE files.
 
- [PEview](http://wjradburn.com/software/) - Popular free tool for inspecting PE files. Displays all the headers, sections, imports/exports, resources etc. in an easy to read GUI.
 
- [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388) - Advanced PE exploration tool that lets you visualize and edit different aspects of a PE file like resources and bindings. Has plugins and scripting support.
 
- [PE Explorer](http://www.pe-explorer.com/) - Feature-rich commercial hex editor with integrated PE file parsing. Useful for deep inspection of disassembled code.
 
- [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) - Powerful disassembler and debugger that seamlessly integrates with PE files. Essential for reverse engineering Windows files.
 
- [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) - Great free tool for analyzing running PE processes, threads, loaded modules and memory regions.
 
- [dumpbin / dependents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dumpbin-reference?view=msvc-170) - Windows developer tools for viewing PE file headers and dependencies from the command line.
 
- [PeNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeNet/) - Open source .NET PE reader for programmatically analyzing files.
 
- [pelook](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/pelook.html) - Linux command line tool for parsing and analyzing PE files.
 
- [PeStudio](https://www.winitor.com/download2) - Scans PE files for malware indicators, version information, anomalies etc.
 
- [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) - Signature based scanner that identifies packers, compilers, malware in PE files.
 
- [PeID](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD) - Packer identifier that detects obfuscation techniques used on PE executables.
 
The right tools allow you to dissect the internal structure and behaviors of PE files. This is invaluable for malware analysts, reverse engineers, and Windows developers working at the PE binary level.

### Conclusion
The Portable Executable (PE) format is the backbone for executable code on Microsoft Windows operating systems. PE provides a common structure for organising machine code, data, imports, exports, resources and other components within executable binaries, libraries, drivers and other file types.

In this post, we provided a high-level overview of the PE file structure and discussed the main parts of a PE file. 

In future posts, we will discuss each of these parts in more detail.
